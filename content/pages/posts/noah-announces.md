> “I was hired by Sheriff Brad Ellsworth and started out as a patrol deputy. I later became a training deputy, helping to mold new sheriff’s deputies into competent and skilled members of the agency. I took hundreds of drunk drivers off the road and trained deputies on how to prepare DUI cases for prosecution. I was promoted to sergeant and later lieutenant by Sheriff Eric Williams. I spent five years developing our agency’s policies and procedures, ensuring our deputies operated with sound tactics and on solid legal footing. I conducted dozens of internal investigations and treated every accused employee with fairness and dignity. I dramatically expanded our agency’s social media presence and focused on communicating crime information directly to our many neighborhood organizations. I obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funding for our Office so that we could better serve the citizens of our county. After Sheriff Wedding promoted me to major, I embarked on an aggressive hiring plan aimed at increasing the number of confinement officers in our jail. I pushed for the expansion of our Information Technology Unit, doubling the size of the staff and improving responsiveness. After Sheriff Wedding named me his chief deputy, I worked to strengthen both the relationship of our Office with the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation and the safety of our schools by improving information sharing and cooperation.”
