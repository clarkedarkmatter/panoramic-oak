# Achievements

In 2013 Noah Robinson designed the interface for the new Sheriff’s Office website that allowed the public to request crash reports, incidents reports, incarceration records, criminal histories and submit requests for temporary road closures.

In 2011 Noah Robinson drafted “Duty to Intervene” language for the Sheriff’s Office Use of Force policy. Robinson successfully lobbied Sheriff Williams to allow this language to be placed into policy, requiring all sheriff’s deputies and confinement officers to take action any time excessive force is being used against a member of the public. While increasingly common now, the concept of a “Duty to Intervene” was not routinely found in most department policies ten years ago.
