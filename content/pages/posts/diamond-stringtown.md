> Thank you to the Diamond - Stringtown Neighborhood Association for allowing me to speak at tonight's meeting.

I had the chance to describe my vision for true community based policing in Vanderburgh County. By moving to a neighborhood-centric model of patrol, we will reduce crime and improve the safety of our residents.
