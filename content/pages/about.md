# Achievements

In 2013 Noah Robinson designed the interface for the new Sheriff’s Office website that allowed the public to request crash reports, incidents reports, incarceration records, criminal histories and submit requests for temporary road closures.

In 2011 Noah Robinson drafted “Duty to Intervene” language for the Sheriff’s Office Use of Force policy. Robinson successfully lobbied Sheriff Williams to allow this language to be placed into policy, requiring all sheriff’s deputies and confinement officers to take action any time excessive force is being used against a member of the public. While increasingly common now, the concept of a “Duty to Intervene” was not routinely found in most department policies ten years ago.

In 2010 Noah Robinson created the Sheriff’s Office standard operating guideline for DUI investigation. The fifteen page document became the go to resource to help deputies navigate the complexities of fatal and serious injury crash investigation involving blood-alcohol evidence. The guideline has been revised many times and shared all over the State of Indiana.

Noah is an Indiana Law Enforcement Academy certified instructor and taught DUI investigation for over ten years.

In 2015 Noah Robinson created a system by which infraction and misdemeanor court dates are pre-assigned for every calendar day and redesigned the local Uniform Traffic Ticket. The enhancements reduced errors and virtually eliminated incorrect court dates being assigned by sheriff’s deputies and Evansville police officers.

Robinson was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Vanderburgh County Crime Victims Resources website, which went online in September of 2018.

In 2016, Noah Robinson unveiled the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office Bicycle Patrol program. Noah created this unique program, which was equally focused on education and enforcement. The program was so well received, it was later adopted by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute as the model for the entire state.

Also in 2016, Noah Robinson created an information sharing platform that linked Circuit and Superior Court Probation, State Parole and local law enforcement. The ambitious program provided deputies and officers with information concerning court supervised offenders, while also allowing deputies and officers to easily notify probation and parole regarding any contact they had with someone under supervision.

In 2017, Noah Robinson started the Vanderburgh County Sheriff’s Office Next Door page. During his time as public information deputy, Noah kept the page up to date with unique content tailored specifically to the county’s many neighborhoods.

In 2019 Noah Robinson oversaw the Sheriff’s Office switch over to a new police radio system. He designed the channel layout of the radios, which allowed deputies the ability to switch between systems and communicate over dozens of new talk groups spanning multiple city, county and suburban public safety agencies.

In early 2018, Noah Robinson was tasked by the Sheriff to create the operational framework necessary for the Sheriff’s Office to begin patrolling the campus of the University of Southern Indiana. Robinson created a budget, shift schedule, radio identification assignments and coordinated revisions to the final memorandum of understanding with the University.

Between 2013 and 2018, Noah Robinson wrote dozens of grant applications and obtained over one million dollars in state, federal and private grant funding which was used to pay for traffic safety enforcement, safety education, information technology, equipment and vehicles.
