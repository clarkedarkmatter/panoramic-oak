## Noah will Protect our Neighborhoods and Businesses.

---

Our residents deserve to feel safe in their own homes. Noah will re-imagine the way sheriff's deputies are deployed within our community, ensuring the residents of our neighborhoods, subdivisions and business districts see and know the deputies who protect their homes, workplaces, and places of worship. Our deputies will be focused on preventing, detecting, and solving crimes by partnering with our residents and becoming members of the neighborhoods they serve.

## Noah will Keep our Kids Safe.

---

School Safety is more than just having a police officer present in a school. Noah will expand the number of Highly Trained and Specially Selected Deputies in our County Schools. The best way to combat crime is to prevent our kids from becoming criminals. By mentoring our At-Risk Youth, there will be no “school to prison” pipeline under Noah’s watch.

## Noah will Hold Offenders Accountable while Reducing Repeat Offenders and Lowering the Jail Population.

---

Our sheriff's deputies and police officers work hard to take criminals off the street and keep our community safe, but once someone is in jail, we need to leave them better than we found them. Noah will implement an aggressive jail based substance abuse treatment program combined with life skills and vocational job training. When offenders rejoin our community, they must have the prospect of employment, stable housing, and a drug free routine in order to interrupt the cycle of criminality.

## Noah will Root out Violent Criminals and Drug Dealers while Treating the Addict.

---

Violent Criminals and Drug Dealers destroy our neighborhoods and poison our community. Noah will assign additional staff to the ATF Task Force in order to trace, intercept and stop the flow of illegal guns into the hands of criminals who terrorize our neighborhoods.

Noah will ensure the Sheriff's Office continues to aggressively pursue drug dealers, while also seeking funding to treat drug users in the grips of addiction. Noah supports the legalization marijuana. Noah believes that otherwise law-abiding citizens are too often saddled with a criminal record for the possession of small amounts of the marijuana. Noah supports the aggressive enforcement of our DUI laws in order to keep alcohol and drug impaired drivers off our roadways.

## Noah will Invest in Modern Training and a Hire a Diverse Staff.

---

When stopped by a sheriff's deputy, Noah wants every law-abiding citizen in our community to start the interaction with a feeling of trust. For a law enforcement agency to be effective, the agency must be perceived as both legitimate and transparent. Noah will seek out and hire the best, most qualified, and diverse workforce available. We will train our staff in the most modern and forward thinking law enforcement techniques, procedures, and strategies while ensuring our deputies and officers understand the issues of bias in law enforcement.
